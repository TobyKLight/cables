# SubPatchOutput

*Ops.Ui.SubPatchOutput*    

This is a helper-op to create a [SubPatch](../Ops.Ui.SubPatch/Ops.Ui.SubPatch.md), do not use in your regular patch.  
Within your sub-patch drag a cable to the `Dyn`-port of the *SubPatchOutput*-op, it will then be accessible in your main patch for further routing.

**Currently not working, will be added soon...**
