# Guidelines
This is a set of rules that will help you to develop ops inside of cables.

All example files for new ops should be made public else they're not available to all users

Every op that draws/renders a mesh should have a geometry ouput<br>
Every material op should output a shader <br>
Every op that draws something should have a checkbox called "Render". Disabling this stops the shape appearing on screen.

# Naming standards
ANY op with the name VALUE should be renamed to `Number`<br>
ANY op with the name Boolean should become `Bool`<br>
ANY op with the name Animation should become `Anim`<br>
ANY op with the name Variable should become `Var`<br>
ANY op related to a physicsbody gets the prefix `body`<br>
ANY op which reports the info about a dataType should start with the word Info

# Data conversion
If a data type is converted to another then both data names should be in the op name like ArrayToString or NumberToBool

# Ports
Any op with a `trigger in` should have this as the first input port, it should also have a `trigger out` as well.<br>
This avoids having to use too many sequence ops.
If an op has a `finished` trigger when an action has been completed then this trigger port should always be to the right of the `trigger out` port.

# Anim ops
Should have a `boolean` finished output port to show if the state is running or not.

# Array ops
All array ops should output null if no array is connected or being processed.<br>
Use `inValueInt` to look up the index of the array.<br>

All arrays should make a copy of an array and not a reference.

```
var arrIn;
var newArray;
// This line below is a reference.This will modify the array in the op before this one.
//Better to avoid doing this
newArray = arrIn ;
//It's better to make a deep copy like this
for(var i = 0 ; i < arrIn; i++)
{
  newArray[i] = arrIn[i];
}
```

# Mesh ops
All ops that work with 3D meshes should adhere to the following rules, to guarantee best integration with other ops.

- If render input is NOT connected geometry output is always NULL
- On creation of the op, geometry output is NULL
- Toggle for rendering should be called "Render Mesh"
- Next output trigger should be called "next"
- Optimize meshes to not always rebuild the whole geometry (e.g. scaling of rectangle)
- Add a checkbox "force update" to disable and change the mesh again

# Namespaces

Every op has two short name, e.g. `KeyboardInput` and a namespace, e.g. `Ops.Devices.Keyboard.KeyboardInput`.

The name will be presented to the user in the patch-view, the long version exists to group similar ops together.<br>
In the op-add-dialog (when pressing `ESC` in the patch-view) users can click on any part of the namespace to view all ops with that namespace.

Op names cannot start with a number.

## Naming Conventions

All namespace-segments as well as the op name must be written in upper camel case, e.g. `KeyboardInput`, not `keyboard_input` or `keyboardInput`.

If your op uses an abbreviation, e.g. `MIDI` only the first character should be capitalized, so if you made a MIDI-input, a good name would be `MidiInput`.

**Please note:** Op-namespaces can not contain the full namespace of another op, e.g. if an op `Ops.Devices.Keyboard` exists,s you cannot put your newly created op in the namespace `Ops.Devices.Keyboard.KeyboardInput`.
