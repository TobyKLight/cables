### transforming an object

to transform an object in 3d space we need a transformation operator

to insert an operator between two exisiting ops you can press the circle on the link between them. if the circle is not showing you have to select one of the ops.

after clicking the "select op" dialog will show up. now enter "transform" and select "ops.gl.matrix.transform" and press enter.

the new op should appear between the two existing onces:

play around with the parameters of the transform op.
you can now change the position,scaling and rotation of the circle:
