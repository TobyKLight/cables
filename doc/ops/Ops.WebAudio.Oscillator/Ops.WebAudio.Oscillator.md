*Type: Value*   
Type of the oscillator, either `sine`, `square`, `sawtooth` or `triangle`

### Frequency

*Type: Value*
Frequency of the oscillator in Hertz. If you want to produce a certain tone, you can look up its frequency [here](http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html). Try something between `30` (very low) and `7000` (very high).
