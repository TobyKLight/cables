# GetVar

*Ops.Vars.GetVar*    

This can be compared with environmental variables or global variables, sometimes it is handy to store something in the patch-scope, so all ops can access it. This is definitely *not* the *cables*-way to do things, but sometimes itâ€™s good to reduce cable chaos.  
Can be used for strings, numbers or booleans.
